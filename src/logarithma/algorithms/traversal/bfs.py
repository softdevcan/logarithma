"""
Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm
====================================

BFS explores a graph level by level, visiting all neighbors
of a vertex before moving to the next level.

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Space Complexity: O(V)

    Perform Breadth-First Search from source vertex.
    
    Returns the distance (number of edges) from source to all reachable vertices.
    Useful for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs.

    Args:

    Returns:
