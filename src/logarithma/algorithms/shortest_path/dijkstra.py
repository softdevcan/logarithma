Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
=================================

Classic O(E + V log V) implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs using binary heap.

    Find shortest paths from source to all other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.
    
    Supports both directed and undirected graphs. Works with non-negative edge weights.

    Args:
        graph: NetworkX Graph or DiGraph with non-negative edge weights
        source: Starting vertex

    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping each vertex to its shortest distance from source.
        Unreachable vertices have distance infinity.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If source vertex not in graph or graph is empty

    Time Complexity:
