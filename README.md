**Logarithma** is a high-performance Python library that breaks traditional algorithmic barriers. Our flagship implementation features the groundbreaking **O(m log^{2/3} n)** shortest path algorithm, surpassing the classical Dijkstra's O(m + n log n) bound for the first time.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Revolutionary SSSP**: First deterministic algorithm to break the sorting barrier
- 📊 **Multiple Domains**: Finance, logistics, social networks, telecommunications
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized implementations with rigorous complexity analysis  
- 🔬 **Research Ready**: Built for both academic research and production systems
- 🐍 **Pythonic**: Clean, intuitive API designed for modern Python

## 🎯 Quick Start

```python
import logarithma

# Revolutionary shortest path algorithm
distances = logarithma.paths.shortest_path(graph, source)

# Coming soon: Extended algorithmic toolkit
logarithma.optimization.solve()
logarithma.analysis.complexity()
